# Skype-For-Web-For-Desktop
An Electron app born out of the frustration of the lack of theming support for skype. All this app does is load Skype for Web in an electron app and insert a stylesheet into it to allow you to theme skype!

## Prerequisites
Skype-For-Web-For-Desktop comes with a build script to compile the code for you.
In order for the script to run, `electron-packager` must first be installed.

Install `electron-packager` with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g electron-packager
```

Then, run the build script with the following command:

```
bash build.sh
```
